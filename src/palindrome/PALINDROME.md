# Palindrome

A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way forward and backward. Some examples of palindromes are “radar”, 
 “able was i ere i saw elba” and “a man a plan a canal panama”.  Write a recursive method *testPalindrome* that returns
  boolean value true if the string stored in the array is a palindrome and false otherwise.
