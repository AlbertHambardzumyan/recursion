# recursion
The concept of recursion.

## Introduction

The programs are generally structured as methods that call one another in a hierarchical manner. For some problems, 
 itâ€™s useful to have a method call itself. A method that does so is known as a recursive method. A recursive method 
 can call itself either directly or indirectly through another method.
